# Research Publication Progress Record

This GitHub repository is intended to show the progress record for modified genetic algorithm in correspond with the research publication.
The goal of the research to optimze the movement operation for minimizing time and penalty points that the SBS/RS [Shuttle Based Storage and Retrieval System] machine took to finish the tasks listed in the dataset.
The dataset could vary according to the assumptions and consideration to limit the scope of the research.

Warning!: This is just a code progress, it hasn't been fully implemented in real life as it is open for other reserachers to create a better metaheuristics algorithm.
all written codes belongs to sagara and it is developed in completion for master's graduate programs in Science and Technology Department of Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan.

Feel free to see this as a reference. 

Consist of 3 parts:
1. Gurobi Math Modelling (Math Model.py)
2. Modified Genetic Algorithm (Algorithm SBSRS Checkpoint 2.py)
3. Result testing and Obj.value Calculation (testing with penalty2.py)

For more information regarding the mathematical model and test results, please see the publication research.
